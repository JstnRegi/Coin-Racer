## Coin-Racer
A race against a foe to gather a certain number of coins to impress the princess. Beware of what gets in your way!

## Game Features and Instructions
Game starts with players putting in their name. Then the players click on the characters they want.
When both players are ready, they lock in their characters with the button. After users are comfortable with their controls. They hit play.

Be the first to collect 4 coins and make your way to the princess' heart with your money! Be watchful at foes as they will send you to the beginning of the board!

## Features to be added
I want to find a reasonable coin deduction system. Maybe not on every hit with a foe but maybe every two hits? Also, maybe add music and sound confirmation for getting hit, and picking up a coin? If I go through with a coin deduction system, implicitly show how many times they got hit before they lose another coin?
Maybe find a way for them to fight eachother if they pick something up? And they are able to try and hit coins from their score.
